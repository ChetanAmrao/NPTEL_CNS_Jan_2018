Simple C code for shift cipher for English language(incomplete)

SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM DISCUSSED IN THE COURSE
Let, during war, Julius Caesar, the general of Roman Emperor, wants to send a message “ATTACK FROM THE EAST” to his Captain in the battle field in such a way that no one except Captain can read it. Before going to the battle field Julius Caesar and Captain agreed upon a secret number 3 which is called as “Key”. Now Julius Caesar shifted each letter by three places, so A becomes D, B becomes E etc. and  end of the  alphabet wrapped around the beginning  i.e  X becomes A,Y becomes B similarly. So Julius Caesar sends the message as “DWWDFN IURP WKH HDVW”. The first message is called Plaintext and the second message is called Ciphertext  i.e
Plaintext:    ATTACK FROM THE EAST

Ciphertext:   DWWDFN IURP WKH HDVW

Key:    3 


Similarly solve the followings:


 The Ciphertext of the Plaintext  “CRYPTOGRAPHY AND NETWORK SECURITY” with Key=3 is…………….
